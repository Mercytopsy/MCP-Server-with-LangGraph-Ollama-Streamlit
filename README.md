## How to Build a Local MCP Server with LangGraph, Ollama & Streamlit

This project demonstrates how to build a Local MCP (Model Communication Protocol) Server system using:

- LangGraph for multi-agent reasoning

- Ollama for running local LLMs

- Streamlit for a lightweight chat interface

It integrates multiple local microservices (Weather, Expense Tracker, Calendar) and connects them through the MCP protocol, enabling LangGraph agent to interact dynamically with real-time tools.
